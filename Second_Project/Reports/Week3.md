# Week 3

On the first week my responsibilities were understanding the basics of:
- Send message to Telegram channel 
- State Manager
- create_your_own_method.py
- ThingsBoard App
- MQTT and HTTP features

and all these are studied well. Report related to these titles can be found below.


# Telegram Message
For Telegram message implementation from [following documentation](https://docs.sixfab.com/docs/pico-lte-http-request-to-web-server) steps has been followed one by one.

1. BotFather integrated via Telegram to generate a new bot for individual processes.
	a. /newbot
	b. Bot name
	c. Bot username 
	Then BotFather allows you to have a token for GET and POST HTTP methods.
2. From related url of the new bot access is available to your personal bot. Messages can be send and received from Pico LTE. 

This application can allow IoT devices to respond relative situations according to commands.

# State Manager
State manager refers as a "class" that manages states for the program. These stages may vary related to the project that you're working on but currently it has features as:
1. Adding step
2. Updating step
3. Getting step
4. Clear related counter to this step process
5. Increasing step number
6. Organizing these steps
7. Executing
8. Handling success and failure
9. Run

These steps may seem easy to write and understand yet they are the core values for application processing.
