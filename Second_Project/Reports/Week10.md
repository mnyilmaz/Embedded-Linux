# Week 10

On the tenth week my responsibilities were:
- MQTT Subscribe tests
- Documentation
and all these are studied well. Report related to these titles can be found below.


# MQTT Subscribe Tests
At this part we were able to obtain subscription values over MQTTHQ. Yet ThingsBoard did not accept connection over the telemetry part and attributes tab. 
For hours of executing could not get any response. Related to this error we've decided to suspense this function. To subscribe device must be shared. At attributes tab device selected as "Shared devices" and device turned into public.
Host has been obtained from MQTTHQ. Relatively of our attempts to configure subscription main aim is to subscribe over ThingsBoard via another host is to obtain data from outer hosts and visualize data from ThingsBoard using dashboards. 




# Documentation
