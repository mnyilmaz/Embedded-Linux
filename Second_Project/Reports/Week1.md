# Week 1

On the first week my responsibilities were understanding the basics of:
-   MicroPython
-   Raspberry Pi Pico
-   Sixfab Pico LTE Module

and all these are studied well. Report related to these titles can be found below.


# MicroPython
MicroPython is an optimized Python programming language that provide run on microcontrollers. This version includes less python libraries and more efficient ram and storage usage than Python. Allows full Python compiler and runtime. Basically as a user friendly Python programming language based aids help to control hardware systems on small embedded systems. Includes all the syntax of Python 3.4 and some of earlier features of Python 3.5. 156 kB space and 16 kB RAM capacity is enough for MicroPython to operate.

> Select ports have support for `_thread` module (multithreading), `socket` and `ssl` for networking, and `asyncio`
>
> MicroPython can execute scripts in textual source form (.py files) or from precompiled bytecode (.mpy files), in both cases either from an on-device filesystem or "frozen" into the MicroPython executable.
> 
> MicroPython also provides a set of MicroPython-specific modules to access hardware-specific functionality and peripherals such as GPIO, Timers, ADC, DAC, PWM, SPI, I2C, CAN, Bluetooth, and USB.

At this point, three main features emerge:

 - **Interactive REPL**: Read, evaluate, print and loop; allows executing the code without compiling and uploading.
 - **Extensive software library**
 - **Extensibility**: Can be mixed with low level languages such as C/C++ to have a better performance.

# Raspberry Pi Pico
Despite other Raspberry Pi models, Pico is known as a rival to Arduino as a microcontroller. That microcontroller consists:

 - 32 bit ARM Cortex M0+ based RP2040 
 - 264 kB VRAM
 - 2 MB built-in Flash memory capacity
 - 26 GPIO PIN
 - Temperature sensor

Also supports UART, I2C, SPI, PWM protocols; C and C++ programming languages.

# Sixfab Pico LTE Module
With ongoing project,  Sixfab Pico LTE Module will be used. This module includes:

-   Raspberry Pi Pico W Integration
-   Cellular IoT Connectivity with the Quectel BG95-M3 module. Offers maximum data rates of 588 kbps downlink and 1119 kbps uplink
-   Onboard LTE Antenna
-   Embedded SIM Card with an embedded SIM in the MFF2 form factor
-   Built-in User Interface including buttons and LED's
-   Convenient Debugging and Firmware Installation, the board includes a BG95 micro USB connector
-   Power and Data Flexibility
-   Compact Design features a PCB size of 60 x 75 mm
-   Camera support via SPI pins from Arducam

# Installation
**1. Registration**
These devices come as unregistered, so registration must be handled at the first sight. Guide to registration can be found from [here](https://docs.sixfab.com/docs/sixfab-pico-lte-getting-started).

**2. MicroPython**
1. From [Raspberry Documents download](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html) matching version of the MicroPython related to your board. 
2. Then press down **Bootsel** button on the board and keep pressed until you plug you device in. 
3. On desktop (for Raspberry Pi users) a folder for Pico will appear as USB drive. 
4. Drag downloaded MicroPython into this drive and wait it to be done and close the window. 
5. Then Thonny or VS Code Extension [MicroPico](https://github.com/paulober/MicroPico?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements) can be used to work with Pico. Example code of blinking the LED's is down below:

```
import machine, utime

led_pin = machine.Pin(25, machine.Pin.OUT)

print("Lumos Maxima !")
i = 1
for i in range (10):
    led_pin.toggle()
    utime.sleep(1) 
print("Nox.")
led_pin.toggle()
```
```
import machine, utime

sensor_temp = machine.ADC(4)

# Pico's pin's voltage output is 3.3 V. Due to that get a significant value by dividing 3.3 V / 2^16 â€“ 1 = 65535
conversion_factor = 3.3 / (65535)
while True:
    reading = sensor_temp.read_u16() * conversion_factor
    temp = 27 - (reading - 0.706)/0.001721
    print(temp)
    utime.sleep(2)
```

In my case I've used MicroPython via SSH because I've linked Pico on my Raspberry Pi. To configure:
1. CTRL + SHUFT + P
2. MicroPico: Configure Projects (Install all required extensions)
3. MicroPico: Run
