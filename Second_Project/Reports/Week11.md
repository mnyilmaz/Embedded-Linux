# Week 11

On the eleventh week my responsibilities were:
- MQTT Subscribe tests over attributes
- Documentation

and all these are studied well. Report related to these titles can be found below.


# MQTT Subscribe Tests
I had already completed and submitted the core documentation for the application, which I had meticulously prepared and delivered on Monday.
Given the persistent malfunctions with the subscription code, which failed to operate correctly despite numerous attempts, I decided to enrich the existing documentation with detailed sections on visualization and troubleshooting. These additions are aimed at offering step-by-step guidance on diagnosing and resolving issues related to data visibility and subscription errors within ThingsBoard. 

In a last effort to validate the functionality and assess the application’s performance, I revisited the telemetry page on ThingsBoard to try and retrieve data. Despite configuring the steps meticulously, the data remained inaccessible. Through further investigation, I uncovered a significant limitation within the ThingsBoard platform—specifically, its community edition. I learned that while ThingsBoard allows for data publication to attribute topics, it restricts subscription and direct data visualization from telemetry topic in its free version. This restriction meant that for full visualization capabilities, data must be routed explicitly to the telemetry topic.



# Documentation
As I wrap up my internship, the enhanced documentation now includes not only the foundational aspects of the application but also advanced sections on navigating platform-specific limitations and troubleshooting common issues. These additions will serve as a valuable resource for the ongoing development and maintenance of the application, ensuring that future efforts are well-informed and more effective.

# Github PR
Also over the repository that we’re currently working on Github codes are formatted as expected and Pull Request has been delivered to the developer team to test. After test phases this application can become a valuable contribution to open-source coding platforms.
