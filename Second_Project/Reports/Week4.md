# Week 4

On the first week my responsibilities were:
- Planning
- Python Developer’s Guide and useful installations
- Deciding app requirements
- MQTT based implementations

and all these are studied well. Report related to these titles can be found below.


# Planning
For this particular part of the project 4 week concluded as sufficient for implementation. Under this repository can be found as "Project_Plan.md"


# Python Developer’s Guide
Overall project uses PEP8 for formatting code. PEP8 allows to make code more readable, understandable and consistent. From indents to spaces, various style rules and applications can be found under this [documentation](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). Even importing style has its own style to remain inside the code. 

It is easy to understand styling and typing requirements for PEP8 yet resolving all the errors one by one is not the most efficient way in a daily life of a programmer. 

For this project I use VSCode for development and Thonny for testing the code on Pico. To bring a solution for this problem I've done research about extensions on VSCode. For formatting I've installed **Black Formatter** and **mypy** for type checking. Black Formatter is absolutely time saving for files. Combination of **Ctrl+Shift+I** formats the whole document within a second. 

My recommendation for formatting files, at first try to find out your mistakes on styling and formatting. People generally inclined learn from mistakes. After completing your quick-search format your file and see your shortcomings.
