Second project includes various aims and purposes. These are quite essential to obtain basic skills of using Embedded Linux, PicoLTE Module, Python, Git and Github, Project planning and so on. This Documentation includes:

 - Understandable project documentation
 - Weekly project plan
 - Gantt Chart

> “Be ready to revise any system, scrap any method, abandon any theory, if the success of the job requires it.”     Henry Ford

# Purposes

 - Understanding MicroPython
 - Compability with PicoLTE Module
 - Writing maintable codes in Python with using OOP
 - Become competent in write readable code in accordance with PEP8 rules according to the Python Developers Guide
 - Project planning and documentation

These valuable purposes is **highly  important** to achieve tasks.
