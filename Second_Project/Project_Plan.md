# 2nd Project 

Second project includes various aims and purposes. These are quite essential to obtain basic skills of using Embedded Linux, PicoLTE Module, Python, Git and Github, Project planning and so on. This Documentation includes:

 - Understandable project documentation
 - Weekly project plan
 - Gantt Chart

> “Be ready to revise any system, scrap any method, abandon any theory, if the success of the job requires it.”     Henry Ford

# Purposes

 - Understanding MicroPython
 - Compability with PicoLTE Module
 - Writing maintable codes in Python with using OOP
 - Become competent in write readable code in accordance with PEP8 rules according to the Python Developers Guide
 - Project planning and documentation

These valuable purposes is **highly  important** to achieve tasks.

# Project Requirements

* A python file to execute app tasks in order to architecture of PicoLTE library
* Within PicoLTE repository under apps folder developing the code as usual as Python guidelines
* Tests related to this applicaiton
* HTTP or MQTT usage is a must

# Project Tools and Hardware

### Tools

 - Python programming language
 - Linux operating system
 - Bash
 - Git and Github
 - Markdown for reports
 - Gantt Chart
 
### Hardware

 - Raspberry Pi Pico
 - PicoLTE Modem
  

# Operation Plan

This project has to be done within 4 weeks. That requires a dynamic agile project plan to obtain the best outcome from the project. Change planning is a must.

## Week 1

 - [x] Understanding Python coding essentials related to python developers Guideline
 - [x] Installations
 - [x] Github branch implementation under pico-lte-sdk
 - [x] Decision about app implementation related to ThingsBoard App
 - [x] Prepare a project plan
 - [x] Prepare a Gantt Chart

## Week 2

 - [ ] Configure config file
 - [ ] Basic conenction implementatiions such as network
 - [ ] Capable to get heat (or GPS) values

## Week 3

 - [ ] MQTT connection set up
 - [ ] MQTT publish and subscribe tests
 - [ ] Heat (or GPS) values test

## Week 4

 - [ ] Example test file implementation
 - [ ] File tests
 - [ ] Data tests

# Gantt Chart

Gantt charts are quite essential in project planning to observe:

 - Timeline
 - Dependencies
 - Milestones
 in a visualized manner. That allows to follow the project better.
