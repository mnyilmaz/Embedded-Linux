# Week 1

In this very first week my responsibilites were:
-   Understanding basic git commands to form a repository
-   Initialize a git repository
-   Learn how to use markdowns
-   Installation of Raspberry Pi 3B+ and ascertaion related bash commands
-   Prepare a project plan
-   Prepare a Gantt Chart
-   Report into  `Reports`  folder
and all these are studied well. Report related to these titles can be found below.

# Git and Github

Git is a version control system that revolutionizes the way data is managed by storing information as snapshots, not differences, making nearly every operation local and efficient. With an emphasis on integrity, Git uses checksums to ensure data consistency and operates in three main states—modified, staged, and committed—enabling a flexible and powerful workflow for developers. More information and schemas related to git can be found at [What is Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git?).

Github is a web-platform that host provider for software developments, using git. On this platform codes, related documents and etc. can be shared and explained. With using git, repositories can be get or loaded also these can be pull requested. These are basic explanations for Github yet this platform has various features to provide ease for better software development.

In basically how to generate a repository and use is given step by step:
1. To generate a repository click on "New" from your Profile/Repositories page. 
2. After generated your very first repository click on "Code" and clone the repository.
3. Open your terminal at linux and write down the command: 
`> git clone your_repo_clone`
 4. Your repository will be cloned as a directory on your local. After modifying your repository on your local, repository on the Github must be updated. Following commands:
 `> git add .` (adds all changes)
 `> git commit -m "your_commit_message"` 
 `> git push -u origin main` (main is your branch name, that can be changed)
 5. These steps will allow users to update their repositories via using commands on terminal. These updates of course can be made via GitHub without using commands. These are most basic commands to clone and update a repository. In further more complicated steps will get involved.
